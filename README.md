# Django channels project

This is a minimal example of how to use Django Channels to create a Real Time application, that uses Django and Websocket.
The main idea of this Django Channels tutorial is that Django generates numbers from 0 to 100, and send them to the front-end via opened WebSocket connection. And these numbers are rendered in real time without any actions from the User.
